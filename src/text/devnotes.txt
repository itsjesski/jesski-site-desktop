Development Notes

=== JessOS Desktop Environment ===

Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: June 19, 2025

Technical Implementation:
- React 19 with TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management (lighter than Redux)
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with custom CSS variables
- Custom drag & drop implementation for React 19 compatibility
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

Architecture:
- Component-based window system
- Centralized store for window management
- Dynamic application loading
- Theme system with CSS custom properties

Recent Features:
- Twitch stream integration with live detection (COMPLETED: Real API integration)
- Boot loader animation with stickers
- Drag & drop sticker pack application
- File-based text content system
- Desktop icon management with responsive layout

Twitch Integration Details:
- Real-time stream status checking via Twitch Helix API
- OAuth token management with automatic refresh
- Stream information display (viewer count, game name)
- Error handling for API failures
- Configurable via environment variables (.env file)
- Updates every 2 minutes, only shows when live
- Security: .env file is now properly gitignored

Setup Instructions:
1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Add your Twitch API credentials from https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
3. Never commit .env file to git (now properly ignored)

TODO:
- Add right-click context menus
- Implement file explorer application
- Add system notifications
- Create calculator app
- Add theme customization panel

Known Issues:
- Window dragging on mobile could be improved
- Twitch embed sizing in maximized mode needs refinement

Performance Optimizations:
- Lazy loading of applications
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient window z-index management
- Optimized sticker animations
